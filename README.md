# Coffee Quality Analysis Project

## Overview

This project explores the determinants of coffee quality using data imported from a CSV file. The analysis focuses on sensory attributes, processing methods, origin regions, defect occurrences, and their interactions to provide insights into coffee quality.

## Key Insights

1. **Determinants of Coffee Quality**
   - The key sensory attributes impacting coffee quality are **Aroma**, **Flavor**, **Acidity**, and **Body**.
   - The top two coffee qualities identified in the analysis are **Castillo** and **Red Bourbon**.

2. **Correlation between Processing Methods, Origin Regions, and Quality Scores**
   - Different processing methods significantly influence coffee bean attributes such as Acidity, Aroma, Body, and Balance.
   - The top three processing methods based on coffee rating and average total cup points are:
     - **Double Anaerobic Washed**
     - **Honey Mossto**
     - **Semi Washed**
   - High altitude regions produce superior quality beans, with the following regions ranking highest by average total cup points:
     - **Laos Borofen Plateau**
     - **Piendamo**
     - **Popayan Cauca**

3. **Trends in Defect Occurrences**
   - There are more Category 2 defects compared to Category 1 defects.
   - Wet processed beans exhibit a higher incidence of defects.
   - The months of November, April, and March show increased defect occurrences.
   - Beans with a moisture range exceeding 10% are more likely to have defects.
   - The harvest years 2021/2022 and 2022/2023 have a higher number of defected beans, coinciding with increased production during these periods.

4. **Interaction of Variables Influencing Total Cup Points**
   - Total Cup Points, which represent an overall measure of coffee quality, are influenced by the attributes of Acidity, Flavor, Aroma, Body, Balance, and After Taste.
   - An increase in these attributes correlates with enhanced coffee quality points.
   - Beans processed using **Double Anaerobic Washed**, **Semi Washed**, and **Honey/Mossto** methods achieve high cup points.
   - The top three quality beans based on cup points are **Castillo**, **Red Bourbon**, and **SL34+Gesha**.
   - The leading countries in terms of coffee quality are **Ethiopia**, **Tanzania**, **Taiwan**, **Guatemala**, and **Madagascar**.
